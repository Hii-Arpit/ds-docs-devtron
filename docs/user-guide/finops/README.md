## Introduction <a href="https://devtron.ai/pricing"><img src="https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg" className="enterprise-badge-img" /></a>

Cost Visibility in Devtron provides a unified view of your Kubernetes infrastructure costs within the Devtron dashboard. It eliminates the need to switch between cloud provider billing consoles by integrating cost insights directly into your DevOps workflow.

You can view and analyze costs across multiple scopes such as Clusters, Projects, Environments, Applications, and Infrastructure Resources. Devtron automatically tracks the spend on CPU, Memory, Storage, GPU, and Network, giving you a clear picture of how resources are utilized and what contributes most to your total cost.

The dashboard highlights recommended costs and potential savings, helping you identify underutilized resources and opportunities for optimization. 

You can choose your preferred currency to view all cost data consistently across different time periods, such as daily, monthly, quarterly, or custom ranges. This helps you move seamlessly from a high-level overview to a granular analysis of costs within a specific category.
