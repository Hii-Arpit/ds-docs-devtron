## Introduction

As you scale with Kubernetes, you may come across the dilemma of inefficiency:
* Over-provisioned clusters
* Workloads running at, let's say, 20% utilization
* Soaring cloud bills

Devtronâ€™s AI-powered initiative redefines how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and DevOps teams interact with their infrastructure. It monitors, reasons, and acts on cost inefficiencies using explainable AI.

It operates across four modules to implement rightsizing actions:

1. [**AI Recommendations (Notifications)**](#notifications) - Automated optimization insights of your Kubernetes resources.
2. [**Runbooks**](#runbooks) - Predefined or AI-generated remediation workflows.  
3. [**Ask Devtron Expert**](#ask-devtron-expert) - A simple chat interface for queries and analytics.
4. [**Audit Logs**](#audit-logs) - Activity trail for compliance and traceability.
